## Topic: 

Blackjack is a card game often found in casinos and occasionally played for leisure time fun. While winning is great, it is always better when it comes with cold hard cash. This project will analyze the hands (cards received) and strategy across 6 players in 150K rounds of Blackjack (900K rows of data). Ultimately, we’re looking for the best strategy and a forecast of future wins. We’ll dig in by attempting to answer the questions below. 

## Player Assignment for Analysis

Player 1 Caitlin

Player 2 Seidi

Player 3 Patrick

Player 4 Portia

Player 5 Stephanie

Player 6 Bandana


## Questions: 

●	Which player is the luckiest?

●	Which player has the most wins (non-Blackjack)?

●	Which player has the most Blackjack wins? 

●	Which player is likely to win with each additional round? 

●	How many times would you need to play to break-even?
